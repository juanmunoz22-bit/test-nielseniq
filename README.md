## Problem 1
`pangram.py`solves the first problem in a O(n) time complexity. It uses `utils.py`as a set to store the unique characters of the string and then checks if the length of the set is equal to 26.

## Problem 2
`animated_dots.py` is a full script to animate a string of dots. As it has a while loop and an inside for loop, the time complexity is O(n^2).
